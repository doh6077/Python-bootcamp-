## Basic CSS Selector Syntax
- .className — selects elements with a specific class.
- #idName — selects an element with a specific id.
- tag — selects all elements with a specific tag (e.g., div, a, span).
- parent child — selects all child elements inside parent.
- .class1.class2 — selects elements with both class1 and class2.
